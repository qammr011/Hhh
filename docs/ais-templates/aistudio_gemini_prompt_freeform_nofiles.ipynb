        "The crypto trading bot setup looks solid, and you're incorporating great technical indicators to analyze market trends. Here are a few potential improvements and modifications you might want to consider:\n",

        "### 1. **Risk Management:**\n",
        "   - **Stop-Loss & Take-Profit:**\n",
        "        You can implement a risk management strategy by adding stop-loss and take-profit conditions. For example, if the price moves a certain percentage against the trade, the bot will automatically sell (stop-loss).\n",
        "             ```python\n",
        "                  stop_loss_percentage = 0.02  # 2% stop-loss\n",
        "                       take_profit_percentage = 0.05  # 5% take-profit\n",

        "                               - **Additional Conditions:**\n",
        "                                    You could fine-tune the signal generation by adding more layers of checks (e.g., volume analysis or divergence in RSI). This can help reduce false signals.\n",
        "                                         - For example, you can use the `RSI` alongside the `MACD` or volume spikes to filter better trade signals.\n",
